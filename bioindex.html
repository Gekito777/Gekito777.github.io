    <h1>Personal Bio</h1>
    <p>

        Greetings. I am Diumer Pichardo, and I am a web developer. I was born in February 1985 in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, 
        and I must  say I'm fortunate to be born during that time since I got witnessed how the 
        tech market grew and exploded, and I always wanted to form part of such a creative and
        talented industry, with so many opportunities for growth and self-improvement,
        so like most things in life, if you want to bring development and improvement, you have to strive and aim for it.
